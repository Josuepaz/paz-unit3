<h1> Harry Potter </h1>
 <header>
 <p> Harry Potter is a great series of movies and books about a boy named Harry who attends a school named Hogwarts, a school
 of witchcraft and wizadry. People all over the world have grown up with these movies and with the 3 main actors. Harry
Potter is played by the actor Daniel Radcliffe, Ron Weasly is played by actor Rupert Grint and Hermione Granger is played 
by the talented actress Emma Watson. All of these films are very famous throughout the whole world for having some of the 
best visual effects for that type of movie. Dont ask me why but somehow Lord Of The Rings beats this movie but i disagree. 
Personally I love this film series and I think its the best in this genre and even the film series ever and I know theres
more people that agree.
